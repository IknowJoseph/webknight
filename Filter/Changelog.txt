WebKnight 1.3 (2003.11.10)
-------------
- Increased default value of Accept-Language header from 256
  to 356 to allow requests from Netscape/Mozilla on Mac
- Fixed minor issue with IE5+SP and IE6 where a response with
  status "31337" would not be displayed. IE4 & IE5 (with no
  hotfixes) displays it! Changed default response status to
  "999"). 
- Changed SQL injection keyword "char" to "char(" because it
  produced a lot of false positives in certain situations.

  also blocked the request when a single keyword was found and not
  only when two or more are found. Reported by Craig Curtin
- Copied updated CFileName class

  header instead of maxlength of that header.

  (no http version)
- Fixed minor bug in UseAllowUrl: it would block uppercase
  variants of the strings in URL Allowed Starts list.
- Fixed minor bug where the xml file would get corrupted
  and WebKnight would use its default settings
- moved some functions to newly created CURL class
- Copied updated CLogger class
  - Added setting logGMT, so you can choose between logging
    in local time (like in version 1.0 and 1.1) and logging
    in GMT (like in version 1.2)
  - Removed #Version directive (confusion with W3C logging)

  for allowing only certain revisions of HTTP

  and WebKnight would crash and block the request reported by Craig Curtin
  Many thanks for helping solve the issue.

  did not enable scanning of SQL injection or used Denied Sequences
  in headers or data.
